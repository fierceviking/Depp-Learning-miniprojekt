# Deep-Learning-miniprojekt

## Inference
To run the pre-trained model, simply use inference.py.

## Code Inspiration
The code for this mini project has been inspired by the original paper and the TensorFlow implementation of the original RNet.

Original paper: Wei Chen, Wenjing Wang, Wenhan Yang, and Jiaying Liu, ``Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhancement``. ResearchGate. 2018.
